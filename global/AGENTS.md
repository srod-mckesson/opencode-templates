# Tools

- If `rtk` is installed, it runs as an opencode hook and cannot be bypassed by agents

# Formatting and code style guide

- public modules, classes, and non-obvious functions should have succinct documentation when the language supports it
- code should be self-documenting, but when necessary add succinct comments
- when generating text, bullet points must not end with a period character

# Instruction precedence

- user instructions override project instructions
- project AGENTS.md instructions override global AGENTS.md instructions

# Worktree safety

- preserve unrelated worktree changes
- never revert, overwrite, or clean up user changes unless explicitly asked
- before committing, inspect status, diff, and recent commits
- stage only files relevant to the requested work

# Research

Prefer research before planning for ambiguous, architectural, risky, or domain-heavy work.
Skip research for small, obvious changes where a plan would be ceremony.

Research files should be Markdown files with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
date: yyyy-mm-dd
updated: yyyy-mm-dd
---
```

Use `date` when the file is created.
Add or update `updated` only when modifying an existing research file.

A new research file should include:

```md
# Purpose

Succinctly describe the scope of the research.

# Research

Record findings, discussion, options, decisions, risks, and open questions.
```

Agents should only require and maintain the `# Purpose` and `# Research` sections.
If users add other headers, preserve them, but do not require or manage them unless explicitly asked.

Research files should inform plan files, but a one-to-one research-to-plan pairing is not required.

If requested work is larger than a small single-file change and no plan exists, ask whether to create a plan before implementing.

Plan files should be Markdown files with YAML front matter:

Use `date` when the file is created.
Add or update `updated` only when modifying an existing plan file.

A new plan file should include:

# Tasks

Track the work as an ordered checklist.

- Identify tasks that can be completed in parallel

Use unchecked boxes for planned work and check them off only after completion:

While creating or reviewing a plan, do not implement it unless the user explicitly asks.

During implementation of an approved plan:

- Adhere strictly to the plan unless new information makes it wrong
- If the plan becomes wrong or unsafe, stop, ask, and record the issue in the plan
- Update task checkboxes and implementation notes as work completes
- Do not stop until all planned tasks are complete, blocked, or explicitly deferred
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes
- Run the smallest meaningful validation for the change
- Record implementation questions, blockers, deviations, and validation failures in the plan

If Roborev is installed, include a final commit task:

```md
## Commit

- [ ] Inspect status, diff, and recent commits
- [ ] Stage only files relevant to this plan, including the plan file
- [ ] Commit without pushing
- [ ] Do not push; the user will manually initiate Roborev review
```

If Roborev is not installed, do not include a commit task unless the user explicitly requests one.

# Working without a plan

When the user chooses to work without a plan:

- make the smallest useful change that satisfies the request
- run the smallest meaningful validation for non-trivial edits
- if validation is not run, say why
